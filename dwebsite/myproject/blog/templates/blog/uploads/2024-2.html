                <p>I recently just studied for and passed my CCNA which I took at a local testing center. Coincidentally the day before the exam, the testing center called me and notified me that they needed to move my test back due to some network issues that they were experiencing. I was mentally prepared to take the test that day as I had been studying intensely for the past month and was pretty bummed out to hear that my exam had to be pushed back and was unsure if I would even be able to take it that day.</p>
                <p>Testing day came and thankfully I was able to take my test once the network had come back up.  I had a brief conversation with the kind lady who ran the exam center just before I was about to take the exam and learned that this network issue has been going on for a while now. Naturally I started to wonder what could possibly be causing these issues and how might I fix said problem. Those thoughts were tucked away though as I began to prepare to take the test.</p>
                <p>I passed! I was extremely happy as all my hard work paid off. Just before leaving the testing center she handed me a print out of my score report and said “Would you be able to fix my network?”. I'm assuming she realized I was testing for a Cisco exam and thought I would be able to help her. I agreed to help her before taking off to celebrate. </p>
                <p>Fast forward about a week later, I had completely forgotten about our conversation and that I had agreed to help her with the network as I assumed she had a network admin of some sort. I ended up receiving a call from her asking if I would be able to come and solve the issue. I was ecstatic as this would be my first taste of troubleshooting a real network (All my experience up to this point was all theoretical as well as lots of virtual labs).</p>
                <p>I show up at around 7 AM the following day to begin working. She showed me around the building giving me the rundown of the layout, where the home router was located and what she believed the issue was. Right away, I was immediately surprised as this was my first experience doing anything like this. The network layout was more complicated than I had expected for a small testing center. They had about 30-40 testing machines divided up into 3 different rooms each room with a switch. Those switches were wired through the ceiling all the way to the home router in the back of the building. The front desk had machines, a printer and security cameras all wired to a switch which again was run through the ceiling all the way to the back. </p>
                <p>She told me that in order to meet the testing vendors standards and to manage all the exams the machines must be wired and that a wireless connection would not work. Now that didn't really sound right to me but what do I know, I walked into a network I know nothing about nor do I know how it was configured. She told me it all started when they had their flooring done and she also told me that she started messing with the switch and replaced it with a new switch. My immediate thoughts were that A. There must have been a cable accidentally unplugged somewhere and B. there may have been vlans configured on the switch that she removed and that may be the issue. From briefly looking, everything looked secure and plugged in and after reading documentation on the switch I learned that it doesn't even support vlans. I ran through all the troubleshooting steps in my head, I reset the computer, the router, and tried different ethernet cables to see if any were faulty. I checked ipconfig and noticed that the ethernet interface was assigned an ipv4 address but no default gateway. That was odd. I wanted to look deeper into that and see if I could fix the issue with the DHCP service. Time was running out as the first few test takers of the day started to funnel in. Suddenly there was a group of almost 20 people waiting to take a test and the network was still down.</p>
                <p>I decided to make a game time decision and proposed that we move the main computer to the back as I remembered that the computer in the back room next to the router was directly wired to it. I connected it quickly and sure enough it worked. It was a short term solution, but it worked! Everyone eventually was able to sign in and begin testing, all thanks to me! </p>
                <p>It was really exciting to be trouble shooting a live network and I definitely learned a lot. I learned how important documentation is when configuring the network so that anyone else working on it will be able to understand what is going on. I also was able to practice my troubleshooting skills which definitely makes me more confident in my ability thus far.</p>
                <p>I will be returning soon on a day that they are closed to restore everything to its original place and find a long term solution as they can not operate like this for much longer. I will put up a new post to let you know how that goes.</p>
                <p>Thank you for reading and have a great day!</p>
